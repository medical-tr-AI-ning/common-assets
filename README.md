medical tr.AI.ning is a virtual reality training platform, designed for integration into the medical curriculum to enhance the clinical reasoning capabilities of future physicians.

The platform allows medical students to train clinical competencies from a first-person perspective with virtual, intelligent and interactive patients in an authentic simulated environment. Individual scenarios can be intuitively created by customizing specific parameters regarding patient, pathology and environment to support situated learning.

**This repository contains common medical assets, which are ready for use in Unity projects, optimized for the HDRP pipeline. 
These assets are used in the [medical tr.AI.ning VR Runtime](https://github.com/medical-tr-AI-ning/vr-runtime) and the [supplemented Authoring Tool](https://github.com/medical-tr-AI-ning/authoring-tool), but also suitable for use in any other projects. GPL-3.0 license terms apply.**
